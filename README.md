# definely

This project is intended to allow the creation of words and abbreviations and connecting to definitions.

## Schema
 - `terms` and `definitions` (1:*)
 - `terms` represent both words (ex. 'balloon') and abbreviations (ex. 'bal.' or 'bal').
 - while each term can connect to a definition, a term can also link to another term.
